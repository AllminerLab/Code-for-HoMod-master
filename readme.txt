Hybrid-Order Modularity for Community Discovery
This archive contains a Matlab implementation of the method for Hybrid-Order Modularity based Community Discovery (HoMod) proposed in the paper "Hybrid-Order Modularity for Community Discovery"

FILES INCLUDE:
main.m                          ---- demonstrate file running on Cora dataeset, default is running on Cora dataset, you can run on different datasets to obtain their results.
LFR_run.m                       ---- file that used to run on LFR_benchmark dataset in LFRdata folder.
HoMod.m                         ---- the main file that implement Homod. 
new_sumin.m                     ---- file used to count motif instances which contain certain nodes
LFRdata                         ---- datasets that generated by LFR_benchmark algorithm with different parameters
toolbox                         ---- files used to compute the NMI, F-score, modularity, purity et al, written by Peizhen Li from https://github.com/lipzh5/EdMot_pro/tree/master/EdMot
matlab_bgl                      ---- MatlabBGL is a Matlab package for working with graphs. It uses the Boost Graph Library to efficiently implement the graph algorithms.  MatlabBGL is designed to work with large sparse graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes. Written by David Gleich from https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10922-matlabbgl
